# Bikeshare App

## An Interactive Experience
The bikeshare.py file is set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset. The experience is interactive because depending on a user's input, the answers to the questions on the previous page will change! There are three questions that will change the answers:

Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?
The answers to the questions above will determine the city and timeframe on which you'll do data analysis. After filtering the dataset, users will see the statistical result of the data, and choose to start again or exit.
